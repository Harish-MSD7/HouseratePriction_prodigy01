This project uses Machine Learning to predict house prices based on different features such as area, number of rooms, and location. I built this model using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. The dataset was taken from Kaggle, and the model applies Linear Regression for prediction.
